\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Autonomous Non-Destructive Testing}

Advancements in \ac{AI}, big data and machine learning opens up exciting possibilities for autonomous \ac{NDT}. Branches of this technology is usually encountered in the context of image recognition, i.e. teaching machines to understand what they see. The same concepts may be applied to forms of \ac{NDT} besides regular visual sensor input, such as ultra sound or eddy currents for corrosion detection.  

\subsection{Large Scale Kinect Fusion - Kintinous}

Kinect Fusion has great potential for augmented reality. Augmented reality is a concept which blends the real and virtual environment. This opens up opportunities to create realistic and immersive training scenarios for the operators. Unfortunately, Kinect Fusion is limited reconstructing a rather small volume depending on the resolution. By varying the resolution, volumes can at the least cover a normal office desk and at the most cover a small room \cite{keylist}.  

Kintinous...

A guide on how to build Kintinous can be found  at \href{Github}{https://github.com/mp3guy/Kintinuous}. The procedure is complicated, as it usually is for experimental builds. It is recommended to attempt the procedure on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 or 15.04 \cite{Kintinous}.
