\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Large Scale Kinect Fusion - Kintinous}

Kinect Fusion has great potential for augmented reality. Augmented reality is a concept which blends the real and virtual environment. This opens up opportunities to create realistic and immersive training scenarios for the operators. Unfortunately, Kinect Fution is limited reconstructing a rather small volume depending on the resolution. By varying the resolution, volumes can at the least cover a normal office desk and at the most cover a small room \cite{keylist}.  

Kintinous...

A guide on how to build Kintinous can be found  at \href{Github}{https://github.com/mp3guy/Kintinuous}. The procedure is complicated, as it usually is for experimental builds. It is recommended to attempt the procedure on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 or 15.04 \cite{Kintinous}.
