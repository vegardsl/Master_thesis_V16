\subsection{Configuring the Bluetooth Connection}

The Qt framework is used to simplify the implementation of the Bluetooth connection between the \ac{ROS} graph and a remote device. Our \ac{ROS} installation for this project already includes some variant of Qt version 4.8. While useful for creating new \ac{GUI} applications, it lacks a Bluetooth API. The latest version of Qt, version 5.5, is equipped with libraries necessary for developing Bluetooth applications. This part of the guide explain how to create a Qt 5 application which can be build by \textit{catkin\_make} and run as a \textit{rosnode}.
