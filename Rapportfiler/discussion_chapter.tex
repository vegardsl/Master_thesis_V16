\section{Mapping}

\begin{itemize}
\item Repairing broken maps? What to do when map is partially broken.
\item Poor odometry when surrounding are in motion, or when laser features are difficult to detect. System can be fooled easily. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Navigation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rectangle base vs. square base.
\item holonomic wheel.
\item Open loop wheel control (stuck when friction is high.)
\item Same as for mapping. Poor odometry when surrounding are in motion, or when laser features are difficult to detect. System can be fooled easily. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Suitability for Offshore Maintenance}

This is just a prototype. Mobility issues.
Kinect-like sensors and ROS could be useful. It is atleast an excellent tool for ''rapid'' prototyping.

\subsection{Open Source Software and Security}

\ac{ROS} and other open source projects thrive thanks to an active community of contributors.
