This thesis concludes my time as a master's student at NTNU. The last five years have been brimming with challenges and learning experiences, but I believe that the last two years have been the most rewarding by far. Both this project, and last years specialization project has fueled my interest in computer vision and robotics. Another cause for this interest is probably also due to readily available libraries and frameworks such as ROS, Qt and OpenCV.

A challenging part of the project work this semester was the openness of the problem description. Looking for, and finding tools consumed a lot of time in the initial weeks. Some ideas turned out to be blind alleys or associated with and unacceptable level of uncertainty. On the other hand, this uncertainty made the project more interesting, and it could be that I never would have come around to use ROS without it.

To students who are considering to continue working on this project, I would recommend that they get a solid background in use of ROS, perhaps by taking part in the subject TTK8, taught by Amund Skavhaug.
